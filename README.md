## Problem Statement

College students often buy items such as laptops, PCs, monitors, bicycles, tables, and other essentials during their academic life. When upgrading, shifting hostels, or graduating, these items are sold informally through WhatsApp groups or word-of-mouth, which is unorganized and unreliable. Existing platforms like OLX are too broad and lack a student-focused, trusted environment.

## Proposed Solution

**peer2peer** is a **student-oriented C2C e-commerce website** that allows verified college students to buy and sell pre-owned items within a controlled campus ecosystem. The platform focuses on affordability, trust, and convenience, making student-to-student transactions simple and secure.
